        <h1>Privacy Policy for Bonobo Games</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 08-07-2025</p>

        <p>Bonobo Games ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you use our mobile games on Android and iOS platforms, including any associated in-app purchases (IAPs), advertisements, or third-party services.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect Directly</h2>
        <p>We do not collect, store, or process personal data directly from users of our mobile games.</p>
        <p>However, the games may include software development kits (SDKs) from third-party services, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advertising networks (e.g., Google AdMob, Unity Ads, Meta Audience Network, ironSource)</li>
            <li>Analytics providers (e.g., Firebase, GameAnalytics)</li>
            <li>App stores (e.g., Google Play, Apple App Store)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These third parties may collect data automatically as part of providing their services.</p>

        <h2>2. Information Third Parties May Collect</h2>
        <p>Third-party SDKs and services integrated into our games may collect and process the following types of data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> Device ID (IDFA, GAID), IP address</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> App usage events, ad views, clicks, and interactions</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, operating system, screen resolution, battery level</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Data:</strong> Diagnostic and performance data</li>
            <li><strong>In-App Purchase Information:</strong> Skins or other purchases processed through Google Play or the App Store</li>
            <li><strong>Location (approximate):</strong> Based on IP address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is used for purposes such as analytics, personalized advertising, fraud prevention, and app functionality.</p>

        <h2>3. Advertising and Tracking</h2>
        <p>Our games may show interest-based advertisements. For this purpose, some third-party ad networks may track your device using advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFA or GAID) and may use cookies or similar technologies.</p>
        <p>On iOS, we comply with Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. You will be asked for permission to allow tracking when required.</p>

        <h2>4. In-App Purchases (IAPs)</h2>
        <p>Purchases of virtual items, such as skins, are processed securely through Google Play and the Apple App Store. We do not have access to or store your payment details.</p>

        <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our games are not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe your child has provided personal data to us, please contact us, and we will delete the information.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain privacy rights under local laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). To exercise your rights, please refer to the privacy controls offered by your device, app store, or the third-party providers we integrate with.</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reset your device's advertising identifier</li>
            <li>Limit ad tracking in your device settings</li>
            <li>Revoke tracking permission on iOS (Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Tracking)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable technical measures to protect your information, but since we do not collect or store personal data ourselves, data security is primarily managed by the third parties referenced above.</p>
