            <h1>Evil Doll - Data Deletion Request</h1>
            <p>A privacy initiative by **Bonobo Games**</p>

            <p>At Bonobo Games, creators of the mobile game "Evil Doll," we are dedicated to respecting your privacy and empowering you to control your data. This page provides clear instructions on how you can request the deletion of data related to your use of the "Evil Doll" game.</p>

            <h2>What Data We Handle and Why</h2>
            <p>Our game, "Evil Doll," is a free-to-play experience that relies on integrated third-party advertising and analytics SDKs. These services help us provide you with relevant advertisements, understand game usage, and prevent fraudulent activity. While Bonobo Games does not directly collect or store personal user data on its own servers for "Evil Doll" (as this game does not feature user accounts), these third-party services may collect certain information from your device, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Device Identifiers:** Such as your Google Advertising ID (GAID) on Android or Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) on iOS. These are used for personalized advertising, frequency capping, and ad campaign measurement.</li>
                <li>**IP Address:** Used for general geographic location to serve localized ads and for fraud prevention.</li>
                <li>**Device Information:** Including device model, operating system version, language settings, and screen resolution, for compatibility and ad targeting.</li>
                <li>**App Usage Data:** Information about your interactions with ads (e.g., ad impressions, clicks) and general game performance (e.g., session duration, crash reports) for analytics, advertising optimization, and fraud detection.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="important-note">
                <h3>Important Note:</h3>
                <p>Bonobo Games acts as the data controller (or joint controller) for the data collected via our app. When you request data deletion from us, we will forward your request to our third-party advertising partners to ensure your data is removed from their systems where legally required.</p>

            <h2>How to Request Data Deletion:</h2>
            <p class="steps">To initiate a data deletion request for data associated with your use of "Evil Doll" that has been collected by our third-party partners, please follow these steps:</p>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>
                    <strong>Find Your Device's Advertising ID:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>On Android:</strong> Go to your device's Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads. There, you will find your **Advertising ID**. Please copy or note down this ID.</li>
                        <li><strong>On iOS:</strong> Go to Settings &gt; Privacy & Security &gt; Tracking. While your Advertiser Identifier (IDFA) is not directly visible here, enabling "Allow Apps to Request to Track" allows apps to use it. If you request deletion, providing any unique identifier you may have (if available) or specific device information will help us process your request. For general ad tracking, you can also reset your IDFA or limit ad tracking directly through your iOS device settings.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Send Your Request to Bonobo Games:</strong>
                    <p>Once you have your Advertising ID, please send an email to our dedicated privacy contact address:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;"><a href="mailto:privacy@bonobogames.com">privacy@bonobogames.com</a></p>
                    <p>In your email, please:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clearly state that you are requesting data deletion for the "Evil Doll" mobile game.</li>
                        <li>**Include your Device's Advertising ID (GAID/IDFA) in the email.** This is crucial for us to identify and forward your request to the relevant ad networks.</li>
                        <li>Optionally, include your device type (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S24, iPhone 15) and operating system version (e.g., Android 14, iOS 17) to further assist with identification.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>What Happens After Your Request:</h2>
            <p>Upon receiving your data deletion request with the necessary information, Bonobo Games will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Acknowledge receipt of your request, typically within **7-14 business days**.</li>
                <li>Promptly forward your data deletion request to all integrated third-party ad networks (IronSource, Unity Ads, Google AdMob, Mintegral, Meta Audience Network) using their respective data deletion APIs or processes.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Data Targeted for Deletion:</h2>
            <p>We will request the deletion of all data associated with your advertising ID that is collected and processed by our third-party ad and analytics partners for advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention purposes. This typically includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID)</li>
                <li>IP address</li>
